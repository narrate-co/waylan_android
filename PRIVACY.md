# Privacy Policy

Words uses Firebase Authentication to create accounts to store words and definitions which have been searched. This includes the word itself, definitions, synonyms and examples.

Without explicitly creating an account, these data points will be tracked using an anonymous identifier. If you choose to link an anonymous account with an email and password, your word search history will be linked to your email address by Firebase Authentication.
